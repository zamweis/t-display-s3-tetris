# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

To keep this community collaborative and productive, we ask all contributors and participants to follow these simple guidelines:

### Expected Behavior:
- Be respectful to others, even when disagreeing.
- Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.
- Communicate clearly and politely.
- Offer assistance and be considerate of others' perspectives.

### Unacceptable Behavior:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Offensive comments related to personal characteristics, beliefs, or affiliations.
- Posting others' private information (e.g., addresses, contact details) without permission.
- Conduct that is disruptive or detrimental to a cooperative and inclusive environment.

## Reporting Issues
To report any concerns regarding unacceptable behavior, please contact the project maintainers through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zamweis/t-display-s3-tetris/discussions) (privately if appropriate) or other provided contact methods. All reports will be handled confidentially.

## Enforcement
Community maintainers are responsible for addressing and, if necessary, moderating inappropriate behavior in a fair and consistent manner. Decisions may include warnings or, in severe cases, banning individuals from participating in the project.
